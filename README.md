# 404 Blog

They say three times the charm, so here is another free responsive Jekyll theme for you. I've learned a ton since open sourcing my first two themes [on Github](http://github.com/mmistakes), and wanted to try a few new things this time around. If you've used my previous themes most of this should be familiar territory...

## What HPSTR brings to the table:

* Responsive templates for post, page, and post index `_layouts`. Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* Gracefully degrades in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.  
* Modern and minimal design.
* Sweet animated menu.
* Readable typography to make your words shine.
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Comments powered by [Disqus](http://disqus.com) if you choose to enable.
* Social Sharing links for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ if you choose to enable.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) support for a better social sharing experience.
* Simple [custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) build script for easy theme development
* [Available in Spanish](https://github.com/cruznick/hpstr-jekyll-theme/tree/es). Thanks [@cruznick](https://github.com/cruznick)!

General notes and suggestions for customizing **HPSTR**.

## Basic Setup for a new Jekyll site

1. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and then install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and all dependencies `bundle install`.
2. Fork the [HPSTR Jekyll Theme repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/fork).
3. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.

[Demo the Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme)

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site.
